# Python_Challenge

## Requirements

- This assignment required me to download and use a code editor (I used Visual Studio Code) to write the code to filter through the given data.

- The assignment started with importing csv files. I was then introduced to 'for' and 'if' loops and iterating through data to store values into lists. After finding and storing the necessary data, I ran mathematical functions and statistical analysis on the data. Lastly, I exported the data into a text file.

**PyBank**

In this challenge, we setup a script to analyze the financial records of a company.

When you run the script, you will receive the following data:

- The total number of months included in the dataset
- The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
- Calculate the changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, then find the average of those changes
- The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
- The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period.

**PyPoll**

In this challenge, we were asked to help a small, rural town modernize its vote counting process.

When you run the script, you will condense the data to find:

- The total number of votes cast
- A complete list of candidates who received votes
- The percentage of votes each candidate won
- The total number of votes each candidate won
- The winner of the election based on popular vote.
