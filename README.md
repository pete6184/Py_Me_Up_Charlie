# Python_Challenge

PyBank

In this challenge, we setup a script to analyze the financial records of a company.

When you run the script, you will receive the following data:

-The total number of months included in the dataset
-The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
-Calculate the changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, then find the average of those changes
-The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
-The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period.

PyPoll

In this challenge, we were asked to helping a small, rural town modernize its vote counting process.

When you run the script you will condense the date to find:

-The total number of votes cast
-A complete list of candidates who received votes
-The percentage of votes each candidate won
-The total number of votes each candidate won
-The winner of the election based on popular vote.
